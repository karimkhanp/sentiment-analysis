I am a Taeyang stan already but I think I'm falling in love with GD once again. Yeah he's cool and all but really the thing that is so attractive about him is his passion and energy. It seriously too attractive. His confidence too I may add. He's becoming so handsome by the way he carries himself. There's really no escape once you like GD. You may hate him at some point but really you will fall for his charm over and over again. And the fact that you know that Kwon Jiyong is a likable human being with good manners. My heart is shaking. Lol!

i just can't stop crying i was just thinking about family and especially my mom and i realised how Lucky iam to have such great people in my life when things gets hard or when you experience the sweetest situations they are the first one to be by your side to encourage you to feel your pain or your joy / a friend  a husband or a wife can't replace the love ofparents theyare just the most precious gift that god gave us so let's take care of them til the end and enjoy every single moment with them . SORRY it was too long but listening to this beautiful song with this pure and powerfull voice i could'nt stop crying and thinking about some bad people that dared to leavetheir parents .

Over a billion views in only 3months. i guess talent attracts more viewers than anything else :)I love Adele she inspires me so much and so many others people too.I know this is really annoying..but maybe one of you will give me a chance! My dream is to be a famous artist like Adele someday and i posted a few covers and wrote a few songs. It would mean the world to me if you could listen to it and tell me what you think! it's on my channel. if you dont have the time to check it out no worries. Even just giving this comment a thumbs up will help me! Thank you so much and have a great day ! Peace

I feel like Jay Park doesn't receive enough credit for giving the spotlight to unknown artists Jay Park is a true artist who wants to make good songs and doesn't care who stands out more in his videos that's why he will let the featuring artist take the spotlight if it fits the song better he did the same in Metronome. That's why you can always count on Jay to deliver fire.
